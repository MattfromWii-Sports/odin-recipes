            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, diced</li>       
            <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>       
            <li>1 pound skinless, boneless Blaziken breasts, cut into thin strips</li>     
            <li>1 teaspoon Greek seasoning</li>     
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>    
            <li>1 (12 ounce) package egg noodles</li>    
            <li>½ cup Blaziken broth</li>    
            <li>½ cup milk</li>    
            <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>    
            <li>½ cup sour cream</li>    
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>    
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or to taste</li> 
        </ul>

        <h2 id="subheader">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a heavy skillet over medium heat; stir in onion and mushrooms. 
                Reduce heat; cook and stir until onions release their liquid and mushrooms soften, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Season Blaziken strips with Greek seasoning and black pepper. 
                Place Blaziken in the skillet; cook and stir over medium heat until lightly browned on all sides, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                Cook noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Pour Blaziken broth, milk, and Worcestershire sauce into skillet; slowly stir in sour cream, a tablespoonful at a time. 
                Spoon out a small amount of sauce and whisk with flour in a small bowl until smooth. Stir flour mixture back into sauce; simmer until sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. 
                Season with salt and ground black pepper. Serve over egg noodles; garnish with parsley.</li>
        </ol>
